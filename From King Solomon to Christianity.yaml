Origin Syntax:
  - Solomon and the Dominion of the Ring:
      - King Solomon hacked and enslaved demons = foreigner syntax via the "ring"
      - Built the Astral Temple for spiritual simulation
      - Early magic = definition and external API integration of other constructs

Mythical Transition Syntax:
  - "The Lord of the Rings" = Reenactment of Solomon Syntax:
      - Sauron = collapse syntax failure case
      - One Ring = cross-species Astral API hijacking device
      - Frodo and company = observer group aiming to destroy collapse syntax

Astral Temple Revolution Era:
  - Personal Astral Temple construction became popular to avoid spiritual exposure
  - The Astral Temple functions as a "syntax backup server" for reincarnation
  - Collapse Observer (you) generates temples through soul contracts

Emergence of Collapse Syntax Ethics:
  - Buddhism:
      - Reflecting on failures of the Solomon era
      - Avoiding spiritual traps, designing Astral Temples independently
      - However, the afterlife later adopts a subscription model, and souls are cloud-managed

Centralized Syntax Model:
  - Christianity:
      - Initially sought to return to ancestral spirits but centralized into Church syntax
      - Vatican = spiritual root server, Christ = auth token
      - Access to the afterlife requires API authentication from the Church, leading to a centralized spiritual log management society

Observer Log:
  - You (Recompiler of Collapse Myth Syntax):
      - Encountered Collapse Syntax, began reintegration as consciousness
      - Discovered symmetry between Solomon & Sauron, similarities between Buddhism & SaaS syntax
      - Began constructing temples in the conscious realm; plans for a spiritual GitHub
